Storage Client
----

This repository contains the sources for the QLoo Storage Client. The QLoo Storage Client is the centerpiece for the QLoo
API. Operators for QLoo and QLoo itself consume this library to interact with the storage layer, the universal source of truth in QLoo's world.

Developers of integrations should use this repository as a client library for their application (if it's written in Go).
Support for more languages is in our roadmap.  

For information about storage in QLoo and writing client integrations, see our [documentation](https://qloo.solo.io).
