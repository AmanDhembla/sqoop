Storage Client
----

This repository contains the sources for the Sqoop Storage Client. The Sqoop Storage Client is the centerpiece for the Sqoop
API. Operators for Sqoop and Sqoop itself consume this library to interact with the storage layer, the universal source of truth in Sqoop's world.

Developers of integrations should use this repository as a client library for their application (if it's written in Go).
Support for more languages is in our roadmap.  

For information about storage in Sqoop and writing client integrations, see our [documentation](https://sqoop.solo.io).
